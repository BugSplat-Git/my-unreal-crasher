## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

MyUnrealCrasher is an Unreal Engine 5 project for testing BugSplat crash reporting. This repo has been pre-configured with the [BugSplat-Unreal](https://github.com/BugSplat-Git/bugsplat-unreal) editor plugin that allows you to configure crash reporting with only a few keystrokes. 

Before diving into this sample, please complete the following tasks:

* [Sign Up](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/sign-up) as a new BugSplat user
* Complete the [Welcome](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/welcome) workflow and make a note of your BugSplat database
* Generate a Client ID and Client Secret for symbol uploads on the [Integrations](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/settings/database/integrations) page

## ðŸ¥¾ Steps

1. Clone this repo and the associated submodules. It's important that this repo is cloned with the `--recurse-submodules` flag so that the BugSplat-Unreal plugin is also downloaded:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BugSplat-Git/my-unreal-crasher --recurse-submodules
```

2. Double click the `MyUnrealCrasher.uproject` file to open the project in the Unreal Editor. Depending on the Unreal Engine version you have installed you may need to open the project and close it a few times until it prompts you to rebuild both MyUnrealCrasher and BugSplat.
3. Once the project has been opened, click `Edit > BugSplat` to load the BugSplat-Unreal plugin dialog.
4. Fill in the values for `Database`, `Application`, `Version`, `Client ID`, and `Client Secret`
5. Click `Add Symbol Uploads`
6. Close the plugin dialog and package your project
7. Open the plugin dialog once more and click `Update Game Ini`
8. Select the directory that contains the `Windows` folder
9. Run `MyUnrealCrasher.exe` to generate a crash report
10. Navigate to the [Crashes](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/crashes) page and click the link in the ID column to view the details of your crash

If you did everything correctly your result should look something like this
